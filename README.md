# smart_parking_system
The objective is to create a deep learning model using the Detectron2 software library's Faster R-CNN method. Based on the input photos, this model will correctly identify and categorise parking spaces as either empty or occupied. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of parking space utilisation, lessen traffic congestion, and cut down on the amount of time spent looking for parking in smart cities by incorporating this model into smart parking management systems. criteria including training accuracy, training loss, validation accuracy, validation loss, model accuracy, and average precision (AP) will be used to assess the model's performance using the COCO detection assessment criteria.
